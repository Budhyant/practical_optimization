# John's Guide to Practical Numerical Optimization

Over the years I've amassed some knowledge about how best to perform numerical optimization, especially as it relates to multidisciplinary problems.
Some of this knowledge has been chronicled in journal or conference papers, but a lot of the practical points do not fit in any existing narrative.
I find myself repeating the same guidance to multiple people every few weeks.
I have started this repo with the goal of formalizing some of this knowledge in a central location.

Each topic below

- [How to formulate optimization problems](formulation.md)
- [Which optimizer should I use?](optimizers.md)
- [Constructing analyses safe for gradient-based optimization](analyses.md)
- [OpenMDAO](openmdao.md)
- [SNOPT](snopt.md)
- [Why isn't my optimization converging?](convergence.md)
